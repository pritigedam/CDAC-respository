ANS-Customer_id

2) What is the 4th column of the Customers table?
ANS-Rating

3) What is another word for row? For column?
ANS-In a relational database, a row is called a tuple or records
 column is called an attribute or field.

4) Why isn’t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
ANS-SQL tables represent unordered sets. So, there is no such thing as the first five rows or last row -- unless a column explicitly defines the ordering. Often, a table has some sort of auto-incremented id column, which can be used for this purpose.
